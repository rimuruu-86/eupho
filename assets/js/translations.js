The <strong class='arc-aincrad'>Aincrad arc</strong>, written by <strong>Reki Kawahara</strong>, was originally made for a contest, but due to a rule regarding word limits, it was heavily condensed and later published as web novel. Later, when the light novel version was published, Kawahara expanded it with additional side stories presented in a non-chronological order. The creatives behind the anime decided to rearrange those into chronological order for smoother understanding, and while it helped clarify the timeline, it also resulted in jarring pacing, filled with huge time skips and very little flow for proper character development and world-building. Little note, I do like the side stories with Lizbeth and Silica, and I wish they do more of that, but considering the nature of the show and its 25-episode run, I understand the decision to focus on the main events.",

Ketika versi light novelnya kemudian diterbitkan, Kawahara mengembangkannya dengan cerita sampingan tambahan, meskipun disajikan secara non-kronologis. Tim di balik pembuatan season pertama memutuskan untuk menyusun ulang cerita-cerita ini secara kronologis agar lebih mudah dipahami. Meskipun hal ini membantu memperjelas alur waktu, hal ini juga menghasilkan pacing yang kurang jelas, penuh dengan timeskip dan mempersempit waktu untuk pengembangan karakter dan pengembangan dunianya.

        en: "Most of the issues that came around this season however, is the narrative execution. As if the pacing didn't help already, the way some characters act are inconsistent throughout the season. Biggest offender is Asuna, who went from a loner, to a captain of a guild <em>(and a tsundere)</em>, and then became a lover for Kirito in a span of 14 episodes <b><em>(2 years in-game)</em></b>. I understand the intent of the writer to showcase their separate feelings, and this could be explored further behind the events that led to it, but again, the pacing didn't gave any leeway for that to happen. Also, when the arc hard-shifts its focus to a romance between the two, they introduce the <a href='https://imgur.com/a/dDnDXzE'>artificial intelligence Yui</a>, who kind of annoys me for some reason. She is a plot device who can eliminate any impossible chances later on, and at worse, she doesn't even have that much of a character to begin with. When she sacrificed herself to grant Kirito the admin rights, I admit the scene is designed to make you cry through the use of its storyboard, but it didn't amount to anything. Besides, after that, when Kirito got through the admin command by smashing random password is so stupid, especially being followed by the previous scene <em>(he's a programmer, I know that. but SAO has very complex code, not even a seasoned programmer like Kirito could decipher it)</em>.",

To start, the established stakes are gone, for instance, when Kirito is able to use his skills from SAO <em>(how? <b>we dont know</b>)</em> and somehow, he could resurrect Yui using a gem that he generated from the first arc, which feels like an insult to injury and made the sacrifice that she did pointless. Asuna is also heavily sidelined to a damsel in distress who contributed nothing to the plot, and they handled sensitive topics very sloppily, for example--episode 24 with Sugou and Asuna when he did <em>that thing</em>... you know what I'm talking about. They introduced Leafa as Kirito's cousin, and she had plenty of potential, sadly that never fully realized as soon as the incest drama kicks in. And don't get me started on the villain. In Aincrad, we got Akihiko Kayaba who, after episode 1, feels almost non-existent <em>(except being his other avatar Heathcliff)</em> until his re-appereance in eps 14, and yes, he has very vague motivation for his actions but atleast his impact with SAO and NerveGear brought an immense influence to the virtual environment moving forward<em>(plus, he's not a creep)</em>. While in Alfheim arc, we got this guy Sugou, who came out of nowhere, decides to be a predator who wants to marry Asuna and is cartoonishly evil in any sense possible, completely clashes the tone of the arc as a whole.

When Kirito attempted to clear a minigame from GGO, which was unbeatable by a lot of players, he clears it with such ease and at the end said that he predicted the prediction line <em>(???)</em>. In the light novel, Kirito had his monologues in his mind about the strategy to beat the game, the writer Kawahara even explained how he did it, which is translated poorly to the anime. Another clear example is Kirito’s sudden PTSD symptoms when he found out that Death Gun is formerly a Laughing Coffin member—<em>in SAO, they are a group of red players who enjoys killing people</em>. This comes across as inconsistent, since earlier—when he was recruited by the government—he didn’t seem phased at all about returning to another death game. There's also a flashback that initiate the PTSD in the first place, where Kirito kills one of the Laughing Coffin member during the ambush, but that didn't shown or even mentioned once in the first season so do I even care that much? The pacing is also uneven. While I enjoyed the chemistry between Kirito and Sinon, some of their scenes dragged on longer than necessary, with fanservices that seems out of place. The final twist is okay, but at this point, the recurring SAO villain trope of sexual assault as a plot device is really tiresome.",

A rare case for this arc, Kirito is absent most of the time, <em>except for some occasions like helping Asuna and Yuuki by clearing hordes of guild party members</em>, thus giving the focus to Asuna, and, for the first time in a long while, I found her to be a genuinely strong character again.

While most of the time, SAO falls onto unnecessary fanservices, this season flips on its head and used it as its strength, somehow. When Quinella decided to be naked for the final fight, it is fanservice, but also very akin to her personality overall, manipulating people with her beauty. If there's another particular example I could think of, episode 10 is a very strong case. Again, the reason those sick-heads did the thing to the trainees <em>(not going to say further than that)</em> is because of Taboo Index loophole, and the fact that Quinella just didn't give a damn about it.

The second half especially, is very uneven and it blitzes all the way to the end real fast that you couldn’t catch up with it. The way they deliver exposition is poorly tacked on most of the times, in instance-when there is a fight scene, the villain will explain the plan to the main characters, putting the scene at complete halt.

Players across the world could use their Amusphere to enter the Underworld, even if its established that it’s impossible to do so, characters that remain survived from near-death battles for so many times <em>(reminder that some of them used admin accounts)</em>, and <b>worst of all</b>, they sidelined Alice very heavily and degraded her into just another side character with no stand-out traits. The strategy to bring Kirito back to his consciousness using memories of his friends is kind of crazy, but it did lined up with the power system of the Underworld: <b>imagination</b>, so I don’t see anything wrong with it. What’s wrong is after Kirito wakes up from coma, he started carrying the war on his back, reducing the stakes that were build up from the start. The usage of fanservices brought harm to the story in comparison to the third season, for instance-a lot of implied harem when it shouldn’t be, and <strong><a href='https://imgur.com/a/pZhtlmI'>the infamous Leafa scene</a></strong>. Overall, it’s a messy narrative.",

        en: "Amidst to its issues, one aspect that this anime always delivered is its production value. As I already said, season 3 production-wise is not in a good state, with rough animation, rushed episodes, and character designs that kept melting. As soon as I noticed the release gap between the movie and the season 3 to 4, I knew the higher-ups fucked it up. However, this season, not only had the best production value so far, but it also delivers some of the best action scenes not only in the SAO, but in anime overall that year. <strong><a href='https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/89d8efdf53ab94e8e26eab385d3186d5.mp4'>Bercouli vs. Vecta</a></strong> and <strong><a href='#vassago'>Asuna vs. Vassago</a></strong> are so artistically different from the way the line-art and artstyle looks, because it is. I never thought that anything could top off <strong><a href='#yuukiFight'>Asuna vs. Yuuki</a></strong> in season 2, but I was wrong. The aces behind these sakugas, <strong>Yoshihiro Kanno and Kentaro Waki</strong>, must’ve been proud for the work that they’ve made. Not only that, the overall artstyle throughout the season is much more polished and there’s no more of that choppiness feel to it.",

        en: "This section is probably the best time to talk about the OP/ED. I saw a lot of people's opinion being that Sword Art Online OP/ED's are all bangers. Well, to be frankly honest, I didn’t like S1 OP's that much <em>(yes, I have a hot take, beat me up to it)</em>, and S2 OP’s is just the same. However, season 3 has <strong><a href='https://youtu.be/v2tmzEuVEz8?si=c2SUyDEPglvbsHfF'>ADAMAS by LiSA</a></strong> and <strong><a href='https://youtu.be/RPZwWt6_unE?si=sgTEb9dnLKp7Ahpm'>Resister by ASCA</a></strong>, some of the best SAO openings I’ve heard with visuals that understandably so, can’t be fully captured by the anime. The ED’s are on the same page for me, until <strong><a href='https://youtu.be/89Y3OnKqLhc?si=3Krs3mL1nhnqpJ7X'>Unlasting by LiSA</a></strong> in season 4. This song didn’t deserve to be used on such anime like SAO, but it did. The songwriting revolving Alice, it’s melancholy and personal feel, with the ending’s cinematic visuals, makes it stand out from the rest. It’s so good that they had to used it three times replacing the usual ending norm, first in episode 1 with Alice and Kirito, in episode 5, and <strong><a href='https://imgur.com/a/Sr318L6'>in episode 11, when Lisbeth is having a speech with ALO players to save Underworld</a></strong>.",

If I remember, the last music-related anime I’ve watched is <em><strongK-ON!</strong></em>, which is a really good SOL anime, unfortunately, it is not really a full-on music anime since it didn’t explore deeper on the music side. So, it’s clear that as this anime focuses on the music in a significant manner, or in this case, an orchestra ensemble, you know I’m all in for what they are trying to cook. With that, here’s my review for one of my personal favourite from <strong>Kyoto Animation</strong>, <strong>Hibike! <strong class='season-3'>Euphonium</strong></strong>.",

Sayangnya, anime ini tidak sepenuhnya bertema musik karena tidak mengeksplorasi musiknya lebih dalam. Jadi, jelas bahwa karena anime ini berfokus pada musik secara signifikan, atau dalam hal ini, ansambel orkestra, saya berharap tinggi dengan anime ini.
