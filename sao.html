										For Sword Art Online, the second anime I've watched, we know the drill. 
										With its massive surge in popularity over the years—and as one of the key reasons the isekai genre became so widespread—it’s no surprise that audiences opinions remain divided. 
										Some genuinely enjoy it, others didn't and be casual about it, and in the worst cases, people jump on the hate train with little more than baseless judgment.
									</p>
									<p data-translate="sao.P2">
									    A few months ago, I decided to rewatch the series to see if my first impressions still held up.

											Season 1 (Aincrad, Fairy Dance)
										  </h3>
										  <div id="s1" class="season-content" aria-hidden="true">
											<figure class="image main">
												<img src="images/eps1opening.png" alt="episode 1" />
												<figcaption data-translate="sao.caption1">eps 1 - <b>"in 2022, mankind built the first full virtual environment"</b></figcaption>
											  </figure>
											<p data-translate="sao.s1p1">
												For the first season of the show, it started off simple. 
												Players are trapped in a virtual MMORPG <b><em>Sword Art Online</em></b> with no way to log out, and you have to clear 100 floors in order to escape. However, with a unique twist, if you got killed, <b>your death is permanent real-time</b>. For the first half of this season, we follow Kirito and Asuna, going through many ups and downs to finish the game, and meeting new partners along the road.</p>
											<p data-translate="sao.s1p2">
												While rewatching, I looked into the production background for a bit. 
												The <strong class="arc-aincrad">Aincrad arc</strong>, written by <strong>Reki Kawahara</strong>, was originally made for a contest, but due to a rule regarding word limits, it was heavily condensed and published as web novel. 
												Later, when the light novel version was published, Kawahara expanded it with additional side stories presented in a non-chronological order. 
												The creatives behind the anime decided to rearrange those into chronological order for smoother understanding, and while it helped clarify the timeline, it also resulted in jarring pacing, filled with huge time skips and very little flow for proper character development and world-building. 
												Little note, I do like the side stories with Lizbeth and Silica, and I wish they do more of that, but considering the nature of the show and its 25-episode run, I understand the decision to focus on the main events.</p>
											<figure class="image main">
												<img src="images/eps14end.png" alt="episode 14" />
												<figcaption data-translate="sao.caption2">eps 14 - one of the best shot from this season</figcaption>
											  </figure>
											<p data-translate="sao.s1p3">
												Most of the issues that came around this season however, is the narrative execution. 
												As if the pacing didn't help already, the way some characters act are inconsistent throughout the season. 
												Biggest offender is Asuna, who went from a loner, to a captain of a guild <em>(and a tsundere)</em>, and then became a lover for Kirito in a span of 14 episodes <b><em>(2 years in-game)</em></b>. 
												I understand the intent of the writer to showcase their separate feelings, and this could be explored further behind the events that led to it, but again, the pacing didn't gave any leeway for that to happen. 
												Also, when the arc hard-shifts its focus to a romance between the two, they introduce the <a href="https://imgur.com/a/dDnDXzE">artificial intelligence Yui</a>-<em>who monitors mental health of every player in the game</em>, and I'm sorry but, she kind of annoys me for some reason. 
												She is a plot device who can eliminate any impossible chances, and at worse, she doesn't even have that much of a character to begin with.
												When she's getting erased after went against the system order by beating a boss-<em><b>remember, this boss came out of nowhere and is deemed rigged to impossible difficulty</b></em>, so she bid <a href="https://imgur.com/a/M8L0ozP">her farewell to Kirito and Asuna</a>. I admit the scene is designed to make you cry through the use of its storyboard, but it didn't amount to anything since the next arc invalidates everything about it.
												Besides, after that, when Kirito got through the admin command by smashing random password to generate a gem with Yui's in it, is so stupid <em>(he's a programmer, I know that. but SAO has very complex code, not even a seasoned programmer like him could decipher it)</em>.</p>
											<figure class="image right">
												<img src="images/fairydancekv.jpg" alt="fairy dance arc" />
												<figcaption class="caption-s1" data-translate="sao.caption3">Fairy Dance Key Visual</figcaption>
											  </figure>
											<p data-translate="sao.s1p4">
												Another issue is its second arc. 
												The <strong class="arc-fairy">Alfheim/Fairy Dance arc</strong>, as most people already called it, is one of the worst part so far. 
												To start, the established stakes are gone, for instance, when Kirito is able to use his skills from SAO <em>(how? <b>we dont know</b>)</em> and somehow, he could resurrect Yui using a gem that he generated from the first arc, which feels like an insult to injury and made the sacrifice that she did pointless. 
												Asuna is also heavily sidelined to a damsel in distress who contributed nothing to the plot, and they handled sensitive topics very sloppily, for example--episode 24 with Sugou and Asuna when he did <em>that thing</em>... you know what I'm talking about. 
												They introduced Leafa as Kirito's cousin, and she had plenty of potential, sadly that never fully realized as soon as the incest drama kicks in. In fact, most of the characters in this arc are forgettable.
												And don't get me started on the villain. In Aincrad arc, we got Akihiko Kayaba who, after episode 1, feels almost non-existent <em>(except being his other avatar Heathcliff)</em> until his re-appereance in eps 14, and while he has vague motives for his actions, atleast his impact with SAO and NerveGear brought an immense influence to the virtual environment moving forward<em>(plus, he's not a creep)</em>. 
												While in Alfheim arc, we got this guy Sugou, who came out of nowhere, decides to be a predator who wants to marry Asuna and is cartoonishly evil in any sense possible, completely clashes the tone of the arc as a whole. 
												Though, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/KJxSg46">it’s satisfying to see him getting absolutely crushed by Kirito</a>.</p>
											<p data-translate="sao.s1p5">
												For it's time, the production is solid. When it comes to this show, they always nailed the action with stylish animation. 
												If I had to pick the best action scene from this season, it has to be <strong><a href="#gleameyes">the fight between Kirito and Gleam Eyes</a></strong>, the build-up to Starburst Stream coupled with <strong>Yuki Kajiura's</strong> majestic soundtrack makes for an intense match.</p>

											Season 2 (GGO, Excalibur, Mother Rosario)
										  </h3>
										  <div id="s2" class="season-content" aria-hidden="true">
											<figure class="image right">
												<img src="images/gungaleonline.jpg" alt="ggo arc" />
												<figcaption class="caption-s1" data-translate="sao.caption6">Gun Gale Online Key Visual</figcaption>
											  </figure>
											<p data-translate="sao.s2p1">
												As I said before, I thought the first season is decent. 
												Season 2 on the other hand—well, I have a lot to say about it. 
												This season adapts 3 arcs, <strong class="arc-gungale">Gun Gale Online</strong>, <strong class="arc-excalibur">Excalibur</strong>, and <strong class="arc-rosario">Mother Rosario</strong>.</p>
											<p data-translate="sao.s2p2">
												For <strong class="arc-gungale">Gun Gale Online</strong>, much like the mystery mini-arc from episode 6-7 of Season 1, it follows Kirito, who is recruited by government officials to investigate <b>Death Gun</b>, a mysterious player rumored to possess a weapon capable of killing players in real life. 
												To uncover the truth, Kirito must log into the MMORPG <b><em>Gun Gale Online</em></b>.</p>
											<p data-translate="sao.s2p3">
												First off, I really like the aesthetic of this world. The retro, gritty atmosphere felt distinct, and even though it strayed from SAO’s original medieval-fantasy flair, it was refreshing to see a game with completely different mechanics.
												Sinon stood out as a genuinely great character—arguably one of the best in the series so far. 
												Her arc surrounding PTSD was handled decently well, and her eventual growth was satisfying. 
												Death Gun, while a bit over-the-top at times, did bring back the sense of dread many viewers had been hoping to feel since Aincrad.</p>
											<figure class="image main">
												<img src="images/kiritosinon.png" alt="eps 6"/>
												<figcaption data-translate="sao.captionadd">eps 6 - kirito with long hair?</figcaption>
											</figure>
											<p data-translate="sao.s2p4">
												Unfortunately, like Season 1, the adaptation cut important material from the light novel, which left anime-only viewers confused. 
												When Kirito attempted to clear a minigame from GGO, which was unbeatable by a lot of players, he clears it with such ease and at the end said that he predicted the prediction line <em>(???)</em>. 
												In the light novel, Kirito had his monologues in his mind about the strategy to beat the game, writer Kawahara even explained how he did it, which is translated poorly to the anime. 
												Another clear example is Kirito’s sudden PTSD symptoms when he found out that Death Gun is formerly a Laughing Coffin member—<em>in SAO, they are a group of red players who enjoys killing people</em>. 
												This comes across as inconsistent, since earlier—when he was recruited by the government—he didn’t seem phased at all about returning to another death game.
												He should've, at some point, thought of the stakes going for the task.
												There's also a flashback that initiated the PTSD in the first place, where Kirito kills one of the Laughing Coffin member during the ambush in SAO, but that didn't shown or mentioned once in the first season. 
												The pacing is painfully slow. While I enjoyed the chemistry between Kirito and Sinon, some of their scenes gave less of a weight, added with fanservices that seems out of place. 
												The final twist is okay, but the recurring SAO villain trope of sexual assault as a plot device is getting tiresome.</p>
										    <figure class="image right">
												<img src="images/excalibur.jpg" alt="excalibur arc" />
												<figcaption class="caption-s1" data-translate="sao.caption7">Excalibur Key Visual</figcaption>
											  </figure>
											<p data-translate="sao.s2p5"><strong class="arc-excalibur">
												Excalibur</strong> is essentially a filler arc with the gang completing a main quest in ALO. 
												It is kind of boring at times since you had to sit through its drawn-out exposition, but the ideas behind this arc is nice. 
												I don't know how to feel about the way they handle Sinon, but I'll let it slide. 
												The main spotlight is easily Klein who finally had his screentime, I mean the writer still gave him L's with the girlfriend bait, but whatever.
												This is 3-episode mini arc anyway, so, no harm at all.</p>
											<p data-translate="sao.s2p6">
												And then we arrive at <strong class="arc-rosario">Mother’s Rosario</strong>. 
												Oh boy-this arc is something else. 
												The story this time centered on Zekken <b>(Yuuki)</b>, a skilled player in ALO who was challenging players while offering her <em><strong><span class="glossary-tooltip">Original Sword Skill
													<span class="glossary-tooltip-content">
														<span class="glossary-tooltip-text">A system introduced in Alfheim Online which allows player to create their own skills.	
														</span>
													</span>
												</span>
											    </strong></em> as a reward. However, she's turned out to be far more than she first appears. 
												This arc also focuses on Sleeping Knights, the guild she belongs to, whose goal is to defeat a floor boss so their names will be recorded in the Monument of Swordsmen before disbanding. 
												A rare case for this arc, Kirito is absent most of the time, <em>except for some occasions like helping Asuna and Yuuki by clearing hordes of guild party members</em>, thus giving the main character spotlight to Asuna, and, for the first time in a long while, I found her to be a genuinely strong character again. 
												Her bond with Yuuki is heartfelt and well-developed, <a href="">making Yuuki’s backstory all the more devastating</a> once it’s revealed.</p>
											<div class="image main">
												<img src="images/yuuki.png" alt="eps 24, yuuki" />
											</div>
											<p data-translate="sao.s2p7">
												Then episode 24 arrived, which is to everyone’s and my opinion as well, the best episode in this season. 
												I'll not explain further, but the first half of the episode is hard-hitting and made me forgot I watched the same power-fantasy anime. 
												When I rewatched this arc, it is crazy to think that this is one of the other times <em>(the other one being Alicization)</em> when Sword Art Online finally found its right footing from start to finish. 
												The only issue that I remember from this arc is that the drama between Asuna and her mother is very cliche and got resolved too fast.</p>

											</figure>											
											<p data-translate="sao.s2p8">
												Compared to the first season, the animation quality had a noticeable improvement, and the action scenes are solid. 
												Most of the sakuga breadcrumbs came from Mother Rosario, which is not surprising why they locked in hard there. 
												One of my favourite action scene from this season has to be <strong><a href="#yuukiFight">Asuna vs. Yuuki/Zekken</a></strong>, it is something else, man. 
												Its beautiful display of swordfight, very good character animation, the flow, the dynamic camerawork, it’s insane that it took them <b>6 years</b> to achieve the same level of greatness.</p>
										    <p data-translate="sao.s2p9">
												A little bit off course, but this section might the best to talk about the staff list for a little. 
												If anyone noticed, <strong>Tomohiko Itou</strong> is the director behind the first and second season of SAO, and it’s hard to explain but, his traits of directorial skills are nowhere to be found here. 
												If you watch his other anime <em><strong><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/31043/Boku_dake_ga_Inai_Machi">Erased</a></strong></em> or <em><strong>some of his 86 episodes</strong></em>, you can tell where his potential lies. 
												I read <a href="https://blog.sakugabooru.com/2017/03/11/sword-art-online-director-interview-tomohiko-ito/">an interview regarding the way he directed the season</a>, and I get it but, it makes his direction/storyboard output in both seasons kind of apathetic at times. 
												On the other side of spectrum, <strong>Tetsuya Takeuchi and Kengo Matsumoto</strong> carried the action side on their back. 
												The amount of work these guys had to put on, particularly the former, are insane. 
												Not to discredit the other animators-few names to mention like <strong>Ryuta Yanagi</strong>, <strong>Ryo Araki</strong>, and more, they did a really good job. 
												As for the soundtracks for both seasons, <strong>Yuki Kajiura's</strong> score has her usual flair with its ethereal yet mysterious vibe for each world that set in, either the futuristic-retro GGO or medieval-fantasy Aincrad/Alfheim.</p>

											Season 3 (Alicization)
										  </h3>
										  <div id="s3" class="season-content" aria-hidden="true">
											<p data-translate="sao.s3p1">
												3 years after the airing of season 2, in 2017, A-1 Studio released <b><a href="ordinalscale.html">Ordinal Scale</a></b>, an original movie that builds off the foundation for this season, <strong class="arc-alicization">Alicization</strong>. 
												Starting from this point on, they carried off all things that were good from it, and kept going with its new style.</p>
												<figure class="image right">
													<img src="images/abec.jpg" alt="illustration" />
													<figcaption class="caption-s1" data-translate="sao.caption10">alicization illustration by abec</figcaption>
												  </figure>
											<p data-translate="sao.s3p2">
												In this arc, we're introduced to a state-of-the-art full-dive interface <b><em>Soul Translator</em></b>, which interacts with the user's <b><em>Fluctlight</em></b>, the technological equivalent of a human soul. 
												From the Soul Translator, came <b><em>the Underworld</em></b>, a virtual world created by Rath with a sole purpose to create the perfect Fluctlight for military uses. 
												Kirito, as one of SAO survivor, was enlisted to test the system capabilities, however, he couldn’t remember anything that happened in Underworld as soon as he logs out, due to confidentiality contract. 
												However, a fragmented memory went past his thoughts, with a single name recalled, Alice.</p>
											<p data-translate="sao.s3p3">
												One evening, while Kirito walks out with Asuna, a random assailant showed up, endangering both of them. 
												And guess what, he's one of the Laughing Coffin lackeys, and with that <a href="https://imgur.com/a/7n9J4R3">the lamest fight in the entire show</a> ensues. 
												After all of the experience that Kirito had gained up in the virtual world, and the fact that he already worked out as well <em>(watch Ordinal Scale)</em>, he could atleast put up a fight and make it out scot-free with Asuna, but that ain't happen. 
												He pushed Asuna, used his umbrella to stab the assailant's leg instead of defending himself, and to no one's surprise, he got injected by a serum that was previously used in season 2 which put him in coma. 
												Later, Kirito wakes up, only to find out he’s in the Underworld, with no way to escape, and now has to work from the bottom to find out what happened behind the scene.</p>
											<p data-translate="sao.s3p4">
												After its rocky start, the story progressively gets better. 
												Kirito has to face many challenges in order to get better, which gave him a depth that he should’ve had seasons ago. 
												The characters are solid, especially Eugeo who’s such a perfect balance to Kirito. 
												Alice is a surprisingly complex character who stands out from other female characters, and she would go through a character arc in the next season <em>(until it isn't, but later on that)</em>. 
												For the first and probably the only time in SAO aswell, we finally had a villain with actual backstory in the form of Quinella, with her god complex ideals and motives born from the corrupt side of the Underworld. 
												While most of the time, SAO falls onto unnecessary fanservices, this season flips on its head and used it as its strength, <em>somehow</em>. 
												When Quinella decided to be naked for the final fight, it is indeed a fanservice, but it's also very fitting to her personality overall, which is manipulating people with her beauty. 
												If there's another particular example I could think of, episode 10 is a strong case. 
												Again, the reason those sick-heads did the thing to the trainees <em>(not going to say further than that)</em> is because of <b><em>Taboo Index</em></b> loophole, and the fact that Quinella just didn't give a damn about it. 
												It also gave Eugeo a reason, a push to break out from the system control and view the world from a different perspective.
												 What I want to say is, it had reason to exist, unlike <strong><a href="">a certain scene from S1 EP24</a></strong> at the very least.</p>
											<p data-translate="sao.s3p5">
												As with the ever-present issue that SAO had, the pacing in this season is as you expect. 
												Season 3 covered the whole first half of Alicization arc that spans to 6 volumes, which is such an insane task in itself that in compromise, they had to cut so many content including a tournament arc <em>(to be honest, that would’ve been so cool though)</em>, even with the additional 24-minutes to the first episode. 
												The second half especially, is very uneven and it blitzes all the way to the end so fast that you couldn’t catch up with it. 
												The way they deliver exposition is poorly tacked on most of the times, in instance-when there is a fight scene, the villain will explain the plan to the main characters, putting the scene at complete halt. 
												It’s an issue in the second season, but they dialed it up to 11 here.</p>

												As for the production value, it is not that bad, most of the time. 
												The change in artstyle is welcomed and I really like its Ufotable-feel in it, this allows the designs to pop off even more, although the animation looks really rough at times due to the combination of trying out new things and it’s horrendous production schedule. 
												The sound design is so DavidPro-coded, really like the new SFX from the sword whether it’s clashing or powering up, particularly Alice's swords <em>(the eargasm is insane)</em>. 
												Unfortunately, if you take a look at the staff list, this season along with season 4 was not directed by <strong>Tomohiko Itou</strong>, and it shows. 
												Even if his directing for the previous seasons was apathetic sometimes, atleast he handled some of the best episodes such as S1 EP14 and S2 EP24. 
												The new director, <strong>Manabu Ono</strong>, didn’t had a good resume especially being a director to one of the worst A1 Pictures anime <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/30544/Gakusen_Toshi_Asterisk"><em><strong>The Asterisk War</strong></em></a>, however he did an okay job handling this juggernaut of an arc.</p>

												Here we are with <strong class="arc-alicization">War of Underworld</strong>. 
												Unlike previous seasons that aired with continuous 2-cour release, this season is split into 2 cours, with the second cour released later in the next year <em>(production-wise, you know where this is going)</em>. 
												However, things are now different, both good and bad.</p>
											<p data-translate="sao.s4p2">
												After a cliffhanger at the end of the third season with Kirito paralyzed due to a power outage in Rath, a military-base where the Underworld operates, the spotlight is now given to the heroine Alice Zuberg. 
												As the thirty Synthesis, Alice has to face the consequences about what happened in Axiom Church, confront the truth regarding her old hometown, while dealing with war between the Dark Territory-<em>led by Gabriel Miller, a rogue in part of Rath raid mission, who logs in to the Underworld in purpose to find Alice</em>-having already invaded the Human Empire, starting the finalization of the Alicization Project - <b>The Final Load Test</b>.</p>
										    <p data-translate="sao.s4p3">
												First off, Gabriel is a real definition of pure evil, who likes to devour human souls <em>(in short, he’s sadistic)</em>, and sometimes, that’s fine. 
												A villain who likes to be one is not a bad thing, as long as his writing is good and if he’s fun to watch. Well, guess what, Gabriel does not apply to both. 
												His partner, Vassago or his alias PoH, an SAO survivor and ex-Laughing Coffin member, had his moments but falls flat aswell. 
												Most of the real-world scenes are dragged on with its on-your-face exposition at times, however it did gave a little bit of flair to the narrative though, I’ll give it to that. 
												For a change, they tried to explore more of Akihiko Kayaba’s backstory and reasoning behind the creation of SAO which is cool, more of him is nice nonetheless.</p>
											<div class="image main">
												<img src="images/renly.png" alt="eps 7 establishing shot" />
											</div>
											<p data-translate="sao.s4p4">
												However, on the other side of things, with the focus given to Alice, she really outshine most of the characters in this show, it’s not even funny. 
												The anime explored the uncle-daughter bond with Bercouli, seeing her mend the relationship with her old hometown people in Rulid Village, and also having <b><a href="https://imgur.com/a/rgPl0Mi">a scene</a></b> when she’s feeling lost for what she’s gonna do next, now that Kirito, the one that gave her courage, can’t do anything. 
												It gave her depth that many female characters in this show didn’t have. 
												Kirito being sidelined also allowed the story to focus on other side characters, giving perspective from their own towards the oncoming war, best example is episode 7 that centered on Integrity Knight Renly.</p>
											<p data-translate="sao.s4p5">
												For now, it looks like it had a really strong first half, possibly the best SAO has ever been, until the second cour arrived. 
												To be honest, I genuinely don’t know what happened to the source material, but judging from the anime itself, they dropped the ball quickly on keeping the writing consistent. 
												As soon as the original characters came back, all of logic and depth is thrown out of the window and straight to the trash bin, as the usual SAO traits from previous seasons came back to bite in the ass. 
												Players across the world could use their Amusphere to enter the Underworld, <em>even if its established that it’s impossible to do so</em>, characters that remain survived from near-death battles for so many times <em>(reminder that some of them used admin accounts)</em>, and <b>worst of all</b>, they sidelined Alice very heavily and degraded her into just another side character with no stand-out traits. 
												The strategy to bring Kirito back to his consciousness using memories of his friends is kind of crazy, but it did lined up with the power system of the Underworld: <b>imagination</b>, so I don’t see anything wrong with it. 
												What’s wrong is after Kirito wakes up from coma, he started carrying the war on his back, reducing the stakes that were build up from the start. 
												The usage of fanservices brought harm to the story in comparison to the third season, for instance-a lot of implied harem when it shouldn’t be, and <strong><a href="https://imgur.com/a/pZhtlmI">the infamous Leafa scene</a></strong>. Overall, it’s a messy narrative.</p>

											<p data-translate="sao.s4p6">
												Amidst to its issues, one aspect that this anime always delivered is its production value. 
												As I already said before, season 3 production-wise was not in a good state, with rough animation, rushed episodes, and character designs that kept melting. 
												As soon as I noticed the release gap between the movie and season 3, I knew the higher-ups fucked it up. 
												However, this season, not only had the best production value so far, but it also delivers some of the best action scenes not only in SAO, but in anime overall that year. 
												<strong><a href="https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/89d8efdf53ab94e8e26eab385d3186d5.mp4">Bercouli vs. Vecta</a></strong> and <strong><a href="#vassago">Asuna vs. Vassago</a></strong> are so artistically different from the way the line-art and artstyle looks, because it is. 
												I never thought that anything could top off <strong><a href="#yuukiFight">Asuna vs. Yuuki</a></strong> in season 2, but I was wrong. The aces behind these sakugas, <strong>Yoshihiro Kanno and Kentaro Waki</strong>, must’ve been proud for the work that they’ve made. 
												Not only that, the overall artstyle throughout the season is much more polished and there’s no more of that choppiness feel to it.</p>

												Now for a little bit of a breather, I'll use this section to talk about the OP/ED. 
												I saw a lot of people's opinion called that Sword Art Online OP/ED's are bangers. 
												Well, to be frankly honest, for season 1's first opening, <strong><a href="https://youtu.be/1aPOj0ERTEc?si=-NmPuQTz2x2RRp7t">Crossing Field by LiSA</a></strong> is really iconic, I didn't think it is one of the best though <em>(yes, I have a hot take, beat me up to it)</em>. 
												<strong><a href="https://youtu.be/J9ZLO7wZlXk?si=KYlCfCmRIg4EYMnZ">Innocence by Aoi Eir</a></strong> is the same as well, maybe a little bit better than the first one. 
												S2 OP’s are fine, <strong><a href="https://youtu.be/hoxUfOTE5II?si=8p67jbXJjKmJlBqs">Ignite by Aoi Eir</a></strong> being the best in the season but it's cutting it far. 
												However, season 3 has <strong><a href="https://youtu.be/v2tmzEuVEz8?si=c2SUyDEPglvbsHfF">ADAMAS by LiSA</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://youtu.be/RPZwWt6_unE?si=sgTEb9dnLKp7Ahpm">Resister by ASCA</a></strong>, some of the best SAO openings I’ve heard with amazing visuals that understandably so, can’t be fully captured by the anime. 
												Season 4's <strong><a href="https://youtu.be/Qo_4XqKwrSM?si=Rb0PXwXz4akBAzVe">ANIMA by ReoNa</a></strong> is catchy, I really like the opening's visual direction. 
												All of the ED’s from season 1-3 are on the same page for me <em>(i mean, it's alright)</em>, until <strong><a href="https://youtu.be/89Y3OnKqLhc?si=3Krs3mL1nhnqpJ7X">Unlasting by LiSA</a></strong> in season 4. 
												This song didn’t deserve to be used on such anime like SAO, but it did. 
												The songwriting revolving Alice, it’s melancholy and personal feel, with the ending’s cinematic visuals, makes it stand out from the rest. 
												It’s so good that they had to used it three times replacing the usual ending norm, first in episode 1 with Alice and Kirito, in episode 5, and <strong><a href="https://imgur.com/a/Sr318L6">in episode 11, when Lisbeth is having a speech with ALO players to save Underworld</a></strong>.</p>
