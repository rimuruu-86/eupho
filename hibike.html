										Out of all the older animes that I’ve planned to watch, there was this one particular anime I stumbled upon that intrigued me from its first look. 
										If I remember, the last music-related anime I’ve watched is <em><strong>K-ON!</strong></em>, which is a really good SOL anime. 
										Unfortunately, it is not really a full-on music anime since it didn’t explore deeper on the music side. 
										So, it’s clear that as this anime focuses on the music in a significant manner, or in this case, an orchestra ensemble, you know I’m all in for what they are trying to cook. 
										With that, here’s my review for one of my personal favourite from <strong>Kyoto Animation</strong>, <strong>Hibike! <strong class="season-3">Euphonium</strong></strong>.</p>
									<p data-translate="hibike.P2"><em>

      <p>
		The story starts off by introducing Kumiko Oumae, a high-school girl who wanted to carve a new start. 
		She's then enlisted to Kitauji High School with that purpose and met her new friend Hazuki and Sapphi- <em>I mean</em>, Midori, only to be unconsciously thrown back into the same, familiar environment that she’s in before, an ensemble concert band. 
		<strong><a href="https://imgur.com/a/Pc6eF7F">Notice the similarities?</a></strong></p>
	  <p>
		In its first episode, as it laid off the conversation between Kumiko and Reina <em>(who’s her old bandmate)</em> about the dud gold achievement, we see the contrast with Reina, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/1D3QlPD">frustrated about not advancing to the Nationals</a>, and Kumiko sat there, unaware of the implications of it. 
		This sets up an idea of <em><b>“Are you satisfied with just that?”</b></em>, and this will hammered home throughout the entire show, so keep that in mind.</p>
	  <p>
		Anyway, throughout the season, we're slowly introduced to the ensemble band, which suffered a fall-off due to different way of members on how they treat the band. 
		That's until a new instructor Taki-sensei arrives, and make some choices that put all the members on pressure. 
		While the story is fairly straightforward, it is the execution that shines the most. 
		I really like that they show the progression of a band in an attempt to improve, amidst from the personal struggles, whether its the students lazying around or a new instructor being strict at times, especially the former which I really relate to. 
		It’s nice to see a well-conveyed depiction of how a real practice go, especially when you want to go for gold in Nationals.</p>
	  <p>
		The second half of this season is really interesting. 
		Earlier in the season, Taki gave a chance for the band members to vote between having fun with the club, or going serious in competition, with most raising hands for the latter despite hesitation, except for Aoi, who raises her hand for the former. 
		In episode 7, with the band internal conflict still on-going, we saw that reaching its boiling point through Aoi, quitting the band mid-practice in order to focus on her studies. 
		This created domino effects, which eventually affect Haruka, the club president, and we saw her trying her best to keep the band unite, to be as good of a president can be despite many people didn't think of her as one. 
		Point is, there's high and lows, and that makes the story engaging and affect you in a way like you're part of it, witnessing what happened.</p>
	  <p>
		The way they handle the characters in this show surprised me, compared to most animes I've watched. 
		Kumiko is very close to how a real person would react, and that makes her relatable. 
		Also, don't forget about every <em>"Kumiko had her exaggerated noises"</em> moments, that cements her as one of the best main characters honestly. 
		Hazuki is the other standout from this season, her character arc throughout the season especially the OVA where she's focused more heavily, is really endearing. 
		Can we get Hazuki some W's please? The third-year students are focused quite heavily in the second half, especially Haruka, Kaori, Asuka, each facing their own struggles and grow from it.</p>
	  <p>
		Of course, since this is a music anime, perfomances are must-needed. 
		C'mon, it's the same studio who made <em><strong><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/5680/K-On">K-ON!</a></strong></em> and <strong><a href="https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/90aeb4cfd99f9de78d56e9672951db79.mp4">that scene in Haruhi anime</a></strong>, of course they'll go ball here. 
		Every instruments are beautiful to look at, the attention to detail from how the instruments are played, to the character acting, it's crazy. 
		Also, every shot in this anime is a work of art, even simple shot like <strong><a href="https://imgur.com/a/4rdV9x3">a traffic push button shot</a></strong> is drawn in-depth like the rest of important ones.</p>
	  <p>
		If I had to pinpoint some flaws, particularly for the first season, it's the way they paced the first half. 
		I felt that some of the earlier episodes are ended abruptly with little satisfactory to it. 
		However, starting from episode 7 is when they started to find the right footing and continue to walk on that path.</p>
