									<p data-translate="historyP1">
										It’s been a while since I’ve watched this anime, around the year 2022, I think? And here I am, revisiting what is, in my opinion, the best music-related anime ever aired in the last decade. The amount of work and passion poured in this project is visibly present, even if in the midst of quite tight production schedule (as usual from Aniplex), and with the right recipe in the form of seriously talented staff list, it is not surprising that the anime turned out as good as it is.
									</p>
									<hr>
									<p data-translate="historyP2">
										Bocchi the Rock! starts off not that well-known, in fact, when its first episode aired, I have no idea that this anime existed or talked about except for some long-time fans, until there’s a gag video <em>(which I think is when Bocchi turned into a Blender-cube or that glitch Bocchi scene)</em> that got insanely popular on Youtube, that I immediately put this anime in the radar, and oh boy, am I not ready for it.
									</p>
									<p data-translate="historyP3">
										It follows Hitori Goto (Bocchi), an introverted high-school girl who’s very skilled at guitar and well-known in her internet presence, guitarhero, and her journey to became a well-known musician by joining a band “Kessoku Band”. Her development is really well thought-out, and really relatable to me as well seeing her overreact and misunderstand things through its very-exaggerated direction and visuals. The other characters are really fun, Nijika and Kita has to be my favourite from the band, Ryo’s cool and funny as hell, really like Hiroi as well with her influence to Bocchi’s character arc.

									<p data-translate="historyP4">
										Since this is a music anime, perfomances are must-needed, and until this day, I still can’t believe how well-animated they were here. Combined with such peak songs and an animation that looks insanely real (mo-capped by the way), I mean it when I said it is absolute cinema. That episode 8 bit when the whole band’s tempo started falling apart, and then the very next song, Bocchi got them locked in by shredding that guitar and did a solo, holy shit, shivers on my body every time. If I had to pick my favourite from the bunch, <strong>Guitar, Loneliness, and Blue Planet</strong> and <strong>Ano Bando</strong> takes the title.

									<p data-translate="historyP5">
										Also, a little note, I’ve been reading the manga from the start to around vol. 3 at the time of writing this review, and the amount of anime-original changes from the source material is tremendous, for example the rearrangement for the photoshoot bit, it reminded me of how KyoAni handled <em><strong>K-ON!</strong></em>, since both are drawn in 4-koma format, there are so much flair that can be added to the anime.
								</p>								  
								  <p data-translate="historyP6">
									Nowadays, this anime is easily compared to K-ON!, both being music anime. Personally, even if these two are on different spectrum with the way they develop things, I really enjoyed the former. Not gonna lie, K-ON! is really good, but I like the focus on the struggle that the band go through in BTR more, compared to the latter’s more laidback nature.

									<p data-translate="historyP7">
										At the end of the day, this anime left me speechless. I never thought a music being portrayed in anime form could be this good, but damn it exceeded that with excellent animation, great development across all characters, banger OST’s, what’s there to say? Considering this came from studio <strong>Cloverworks</strong>, a studio that unfortunately got more L’s than W’s (don’t get me started with the way they treated WEP and DITF near the end), they really played all their wildcards here. <strong>Keiichiro Saito</strong> and his team played a huge role making the anime the way it is. You know what, with season 2 announced, just so you know, I’m hyped for it.
